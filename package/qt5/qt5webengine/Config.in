	  The Qt WebEngine module provides a web browser engine that makes it
	  easy to embed content from the World Wide Web into your Qt application
	  on platforms that do not have a native web engine.

	  Qt WebEngine provides C++ classes and QML types for rendering HTML,
	  XHTML, and SVG documents, styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
	  and scripted with JavaScript. HTML documents can be made fully
	  editable by the user through the use of the contenteditable attribute
	  on HTML elements.
